The weights were finetuned after training the specified notebook for 5 epochs using GPU on Google Colab.

It is recommended to use a GPU, otherwise Transformer models can take a very long time to train on simple CPUs.  
But once the model is trained and saved, we can use CPU for inference/deployment purposes.
